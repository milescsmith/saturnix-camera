## What is SATURNIX?

SATURNIX is a DIY digital camera built on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with a 16MP autofocus sensor, 2" LCD viewfinder, and built-in film simulation engine. It shoots RAW+JPG and processes photos on-device with cinematic color profiles — from Kodak Gold to a custom anime-inspired preset.

No apps. No cloud. Just a camera.

## Features

**Camera**
- 16MP autofocus sensor (Arducam IMX519)
- RAW (DNG) + JPG capture
- Full manual controls: Shutter (30s–1/4000), ISO (100–3200), WB, EV
- Autofocus modes: AF-C (continuous), AF-S (single), MF (manual)

**Film Simulations**
- **SATURNIX** — signature preset: golden light, anime-style rendering, indigo shadows, bloom
- **Kodak Gold 400** — warm, vintage, creamy tones
- **Kodak Ektar 100** — hyper-saturated, razor sharp, deep colors
- **Fujifilm 400** — cool greens, balanced tones
- **Kodak Tri-X 400** — classic black & white, deep blacks, rich grain
- **VHS** — lo-fi tape look: scanlines, chromatic aberration, noise

**Interface**
- 2" LCD live preview at 320×240
- Auto-hide UI (clean viewfinder after 15s)
- Live histogram with exposure traffic light
- Composition grids (Thirds, Golden Ratio, Cross)
- AF indicator with auto-detection
- CPU temperature & storage monitoring
- Persistent settings (survive reboot)

**Connectivity**
- Built-in WiFi hotspot for photo transfer
- Retro terminal-style web gallery
- No internet required — direct device-to-phone

**Audio**
- Passive buzzer feedback for all actions
- Customizable: shutter, focus, navigation, startup sounds
- Mute mode
